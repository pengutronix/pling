pling
=====

pling is A small Python 3 script to allow the sending of a WOL Magic
packet so that LAN clients can be remotely switched on from another
machine on the same subnet. Rather than needing to know the MAC address
of the desired machine, the script allows you to specify by hostname, so
long as that host is included in the configuration file.

Why another WakeonLan tool?
---------------------------

- pling can be used by normal users.
- pling calculates MAC-addresses from autogenerated IPv6 addresses.
- pling searches DNS for \_linklocaldomain SRV record and try to get linklocal addresses from it.
- pling sends magic packets on every possible Interface via IPv6 and legacyIP

Usage
-------

> pling \[hostname\]

> pling --list



Configuration File
--------------------

The configuration file is just a basic INI file, containing one section per host;

> \[General\]
>
> broadcast=192.168.1.255
>
> \[MyPc\]
>
> mac=00:13:0d:e4:60:61
